## Summary

This app allows users to easily keep track of their virtual recipe notes. The app requires authentication so a user has to sign up for an account or, if they would like to simply tour the app and get a feel for how it works, demo login credentials are provided in the Live Demo landing page. Once logged in, a user can see all of their previously saved recipe entries. They can add a new recipe by including the link to the virtual recipe, the recipe name, any notes, and an image url to be displayed on the My Recipes page. A user can also edit or delete previously saved recipes.
